; classification option (inside `building` and before first `levels`)
; Example:
;     classification core|defence|military|trade|water|culture|religious (deprecated, but recognised:fortification|infrastructure|other)
; This tells the game which category of the building browser to use.
; RomeHD has subtly different classifications than the original, so note the deprecated classifications, they wont work anymore.
; If no classification is specified, the game will guess based on the building name, which works for all the unmodded buildings.
; Automatic classification:
;   core_building
;       core
;   defenses
;       defence
;   barracks|equestrian|missiles|smith|despotic_law
;       military
;   market|port_buildings|hinterland_*|caravans
;       trade
;   health
;       water
;   academic|amphitheatres|theatres|taverns
;       culture
;   temple_*|christian_acedemic
;       religious
; Explicit classification overrides the automatic classification, so if you don't like the above classifications, you can overule them.
