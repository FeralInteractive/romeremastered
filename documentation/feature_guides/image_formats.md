## Introduction

Below you'll find a list of all the major images used throughout the game from in game textures to loading screens. These can be used as a reference when modding different areas of the game to ensure you are saving textures in the correct format.


## Faction Icons

 * Format: .TGA 32 bits
 * Aspect Ratio: 1:1
 * Resolution: 512x512
 * Tested the following ratios and resolutions with no major issues visible:
   * 1920x1080 16:9
   * 960x640 3:2
   * 1024x768 4:3
   * 3840x2160 16:9

## Unit Cards

 * Format: .TGA 32 bits w/ Alpha channel
 * Aspect Ratio: 4:3
 * Resolution: 164x224
 * Tested the following ratios and resolutions with no major issues visible:
   * 1920x1080 16:9
   * 960x640 3:2
   * 1024x768 4:3
   * 3840x2160 16:9

## Large Unit Images

 * Format: .TGA 32 bits w/ Alpha Channel
 * Aspect Ratio: 4:3
 * Resolution: 328x448
 * Tested the following ratios and resolutions with no major issues visible:
   * 1920x1080 16:9
   * 960x640 3:2
   * 1024x768 4:3
   * 3840x2160 16:9 - caused graphical corruption on main menu

## Building Cards 

 * Format: .TGA 32 bits w/ Alpha Channel
 * Resolution: 128x102 
 * Tested the following ratios and resolutions with no major issues visible:
   * 1920x1080 16:9
   * 960x640 3:2
   * 1024x768 4:3
   * 3840x2160 16:9

## News Banners
 * Format: .TGA 24 bits
 * Various resolutions and ratios present

## 3D Unit Textures

 * Format: .DDS 
 * Resolution: 2048x2048
 * Aspect Ratio: 1:1
 * Compression:
   * Diffuse - BC1 4bpp
   * Diffuse + Alpha - BC3 8bpp
   * Normal - BC5 8bpp
   * Greyscale maps - BC4 4bpp
 * Compression completed with Intel Texture Works v1.0.4 plugin for Photoshop CC
 * Compressed further in LZ4
 * **Supports MIPS**
 * Using a different Image Resolution and ratio did not cause any errors, however UV layout should be taken into account if this is altered. Textures split into a diffuse and normal maps (_pbr at end of normal map file name).
 * Tested the following ratios and resolutions with no major issues visible:
   * 960x640 3:2
   * 3840x2160 16:9
   * 1024x768 4:3
   * 1920x1080 16:9

## Hair Textures

 * Format: DDS DXT5
   * Red Channel = X Normals
   * Green Channel = Y Normals
   * Blue Channel = Diffuse Brightness
   * Alpha Channel = Alpha 
 * Resolution: 9216 x 1024
 * LZ4 Compression
 * **Supports MIPS**
 * All hairstyles exist in a single texture map.

## 3D Building Textures

 * Format: .DDS w/ Alpha Channel (Alpha Channel present for texture maps with transparency)
 * Various resolutions and aspect ratios present
 * **Notes:** Textures with an alpha channel typically saved with a ‘##’ or ‘#&’ at the start of the name. Each texture has a Diffuse Map, Normal map (file name contains ‘_n’) and a Roughness map (file name contains _s). Some files also contain a Metallic map (file name contains ‘_m)
 * Compression:
   * Diffuse - BC1 4bpp
   * Diffuse + Alpha - BC3 8bpp
   * Normal - BC5 8bpp
   * Greyscale maps - BC4 4bpp
 * Compression completed with Intel Texture Works v1.0.4 plugin for Photoshop CC
 * **Supports MIPS**


## 3D Specialist textures (trees, shrubs etc if applicable)

 * Format: .DDS **Supports MIPS**
 * Resolution: 2048x1024 **Supports MIPS**
 * Aspect Ratio: 2:1 **Supports MIPS**
 * Compression: **Supports MIPS**
   * Diffuse + Alpha - BC3 8bpp
   * Normal - BC5 8bpp
   * Roughness - BC4 4bpp
 * Compression completed with Intel Texture Works v1.0.4 plugin for Photoshop CC
 * Notes: Any resolution and ratio supported (as long as rule of 2n is abided by either height or width)

## UI Textures

 * Format: .TGA 32 bits
 * Various aspect ratios and resolutions present

## Loading Screens

 * Format: .DDS DXT5
 * **Supports MIPS**
 * Notes: Aspect ratio is reccomended to be 16:9 or 64:27 ratios. Other none standard ratios can cause the game to crash.

## Large Overview Map

 * Format: .DDS DXT5
 * Notes: Any resolution and ratio should work (as long as rule of 2n is abided by either height or width). You should also match the ratio of the actual map so it alligns.
