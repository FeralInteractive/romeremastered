## Swap Merge & Sort Behaviour

In Rome Remastered you can sort your units on the campaign map into the orders you like, this is then remembered when you enter and leave battles meaning you can organise your armies as you recuit them on the map.

There are buttons in the UI to auto sort and auto merge units in your armies on the bottom of the screen.

![AutoMerge_Autosort](/documentation/feature_guides/images/AutoMerge_Autosort.jpg)

By default dragging will reorder units and you can use ctrl and drag to manually merge units. You can however swap this behaviour around inside the preferences folder if you prefer.

 1. Open the Pre-Game Options Panel and go to the Support tab
 2. Click on the `Open Preferences Folder` button.
![SupportOpenPreferences](/documentation/feature_guides/images/SupportOpenPreferences.jpg)
 3. Quick the launcher using the `Quit` button
 4. Now open the `Preferences Data` file from the `Total War ROME REMASTERED` in a text editor.
 5. Search for the line with `CtrlToMerge`. Edit the line so the value is `0` instead of `1`. Afterwards it should look like the line in point 6 below. 
 6. `<value name="CtrlToMerge" type="integer">0</value>`
 7. Save the file and restart the game. You can now merge by default and hold down ctrl if you want to reorder.

## Disaster Values

The maximum values for disasters and disaster events are technically unlimited but the engine will cap the max value to the following limits when triggering them in game.

* Earthquake 9
* Flood 9
* Volcano 9
* Storm 13

## read_no_endian error

```read_no_endian(&data, sizeof(T)) Failed``` 

This error implies that the system that's reading the file has hit EoF (End Of File)  where it wasn't expecting it. i.e. the game was expecting the file to be longer than it actually was. You should check the file for any missing for incorrectly formatted items. In some cases adding an extra empty line at the end of the file can fix some parsing errors.

## CA_RAND_MAX Values

The CA_RAND_MAX value matches the minimum guaranteed value of RAND_MAX by the c++ spec. This is 32767. The random number genertor is using LFSR.


## defender->battle_combo_get().defense error

When making new units you can see the following error:

`defender->battle_combo_get().defense.m_is_valid Failed
An attack is being performed on something which does not have a valid defense. Why?`

This means the second value in `stat_pri_armour` or `stat_sec_armour` has been set to zero. The miniumum value allowed is 1.


## export_descr_character_traits

Sometimes you can get errors that a token is not recognised in your traits file. This can be caused by a typo in the trait capitalisation.

```Script Error in Q:\Feral\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Mods\My Mods\example_mod/data/export_descr_character_traits.txt, at line 8046, column 15. Condition parser doesn't recognise this token: Battleodds```

Remember that Triggers are CaseSensitive so `BattleOdds` and `Battleodds` are not the same trigger so make sure you don't have differnt capitalisation in different places. That all need to be the same including the case.

## descr_quick_battle_locations

descr_quick_battle_locations.txt has a list of coordinates used in the quick battles option. This was hard coded in the original game but broken out into a text file for RR. The coordinate values have a 1:1 relationship with the pixel location on the map_regions.tga map files for your mod.

## Unexpected in condition parsing error

`Unexpected in condition parsing:` is exclusively used when the game is expecting an "and" or "or" usually on the line listed in the error log.

## descr_fog_params

This allows you to alter the dynamic behavour of fog, some minor items to note.

* `fog`, `static_fog` or `dynamic_fog`, all need to be present
* `fog_main_layer_height` is also typo'd in the code, you need to use `m_fog_main_layer_height` instead.

Dynamic Fog Default values include:

* `Scaling = 500`
* `wanted particles = 4`
* `spawn interval = 0.17`
* `constrast power = 0.96`

![fog_defaults.png](/documentation/feature_guides/images/fog_defaults.png)

## ambient_settlements

Below is a quick memory dump of some useful information for people wanting to mod this area of the game.

The game will usually attempt to place **up to** 5 randomly selected items from each type (except farms, number of which depends on fertility of the tile). The `always` tage forces the game to always attempt to place a given entry at the end of the placing function.

For farms, the number placed depends on the fertility of the tile and if it is cultivated. In addition when you place a farm, it also places a random number of children too so cultivated mid fertility will try and place 5-10 children aroud the farm using the following logic:

```
               | Not cultivated          | Cultivated
---------------+-------------------------+--------------------------
Low fertility  | no farms                | 1-3 farms, 0-5 children
---------------+-------------------------+--------------------------
Mid fertility  | 0-1 farms, 0-2 children | 3-6 farms, 5-10 children
---------------+-------------------------+--------------------------
High fertility | 0-2 farms, 0-4 children | 6-10 farms, 10-15 children
```

For other ambient items the following addional limitations are present.

* `Watchtower` is just 1, (if the tile has a watchtower)
* `forestry` is unused
* `mines` is unused
* `natural` is just straight 0-5 dice roll 
* `monuments` is just straight 0-5 dice roll 
* `ruins` is just straight 0-5 dice roll 
* `ancient battlefield` is 1, if the location is the site of a famous battle (has a crossed swords icon on the campaign map)

## Output Variables To Log

If you want to dump a variables values to the log for debugging you can use something in the following format.

`console_command check_persistent_var <variable name>`

You should avoid using the `script_log` command as that dumps to stdout not the log file.

## Volcano

You can trigger volcanos inside a script using the command `console_command event volcano <x> <y>`

The volcano will start smoking then the command is triggered then erupt the following turn.

## Disable Major Events using descr_strat

You can have multiple campaigns inside the same mod and manually control them from inside the descr_strat file using the following command. Here is an example of how to disable the marion reforms along with some notes on formatting.

```
set_major_event_enabled marian_reforms, false

;;major event status can be set for individual factions with:
;  trigger_status marian_reforms, empire_east, true
;;or for all factions with:
;  trigger_status marian_reforms, true
```

## Battle Calculations and Bonuses

In this subsection we have a number of bits of information on how the game logic calculates bonuses and unit sizes. These cannot be modded but can be useful when modding units to ensure good overall balance.

### Generals Bodyguard Size

The bodyguard calculation gives the size of the unit before the unit scale modifier is applied.

 1. Start with the default bodyguard unit size. This is defined in the EDU, in the example below the starting value will be `12`.
 
```
type             roman generals guard cavalry early
dictionary       roman_generals_guard_cavalry_early      ; Roman General
category         cavalry
class            heavy
voice_type       Heavy_1
voice_indexes    0 1 2
soldier          roman_medium_cavalry, 12, 0, 1
mount            generals horse
```

 2. Add `+6` if it's the faction leader
 3. Add `+4` if it's the faction heir
 4. Add half of the character's influence start, rounded down
 5. Add the character's `PersonalSecurity` stat
 7. Clamp resulting number between `4` and `31`
 8. Multiply the resulting value by the unit scale factor to get the final unit size

NOTE: The General and other officers (i.e. centurions and standard bearers in legionary cohorts) aren't counted towards this number.

### Generals Battle Bonuses

Your General will give all your units some bonuses to their morale, they don't impact any of the other stats. These bonuses are as follows:

 * The general gives `+12` morale to their bodyguard unit while they're rallying, and `+8` at all other times. This is on top of the base value below.
 * The general gives nearby units `+10` morale when they are rallying and `+4` at all other times. This is on top of the base value below.
 * As long as the general is alive, all units on the field no matter how far from the general get a base morale bonus of `2 + command points + half influence + TroopMorale stat`.
 * The range of influence of a General is calculated using the following formula `6 + (7 * command) + (4 * influence)`. The number is using the internal engine distance this should be assumed to be similar to meters inside the game world.
 * Units can only be influenced by the general that is in command of their army. Killing any secondary generals or generals in reinforcing armies will have no effect on the main army beyond removing the +8 morale bonus given to bodyguard units at all time listed above
 
Extra information about General's influence range: 
 
 * Being near a general makes a broken unit rally sooner than they would otherwise
(assuming it's possible for them to rally).
 * Units that can charge without orders won't do so if they're near the general.
 * A General's rallying buff will be combined with any separate chanting and screeching bonuses that are within the same range.

### Chanting and Screeching Bonuses


 * Being in range of friendly chanting grants `+6` morale, being in range of enemy chanting gives `-5`.
 * Being in range of friendly  screeching will grant `+3`  morale, being in range of enemy screeching gives `-5`.
 * Chanting takes priority over screeching if both are active by the same side.
 * You cannot stack multiple bonuses at once, only a single one will count for any specific unit. For example if you trigger 2x Chanting and 1x Screeching units within the range of a 4th unit that unit will only ever get a single buff at once.
 * If both factions have buff's running at once both the positive and negative values are calculated for units in the area of influence.
 * The units doing the chanting/screeching **do not get the bonus from the action*** only units around them.
 * Units with chanting or screeching abilities **can still get the bonus from other units*** if they are within range they just cannot buff themselves.
 * If multiple buffs are within range and one of them runs out the game will switch to the next best buff to apply automatically. 
 * Neither of these bonuses effect anything other than morale.
 * Both effects have a range of 75 using the internal engine distance this should be assumed to be similar to meters inside the game world.
 
 * If a unit has more friendly chanting units influencing it than enemy chanting units, it gains a +2 to hit
 * If a unit has more enemy screeching units influencing it than friendly screeching units, it gains a -2 to hit
 
 For example:
 
 * If your unit is chanting and they are within range of an enemy unit screeching your units overall buff is +1 (+6-5) and theirs will be -2 (+3-5).
 * Having two monk units on the same side chanting next to each other will give surrounding units a single buff from chanting but they will also additionally buff each others stats. This means although the bonus doesn't stack you can use multiple units to ensure even the unit chanting has an active buff to morale.
 * If a unit is within range of 3 friendly screeching units, and 2 enemy screeching units, it's chance to hit will not suffer the -2 debuff due to having more friendly screeching units than enemies
 
 ### Warcry and Berserk Bonuses
 
 Warcry and Berserk bonuses don't have any bonuses to nearby units and only impact their own stats. Both of these features impact the default recovery time for a unit. 
 
  * The recovery time is stored in the EDU in the `stat_pri` and `stat_sec` values. They are the second to last numbers on those lines.
  * This represents the number of deciseconds (10ths of a second) that units will take, on average, between attacks.
  * When a soldier makes an attack, they will add a random number between -5 to +5 to the base stat and wait that long before making another attack
  
  * If a unit is berserk, the stat is reduced to 25% of it's original value
  
  * Warcry can reduce the stat by between 40% to 100% depending on how long the warcry is allowed to charge up
  * After starting a unit's warcry ability, they will begin to taunt and a counter will begin to increment in the background
  * If a unit is attacked, ordered to move, or otherwise have their taunting interrupted, the counter will remain frozen at wherever it was
  * After 2.8 seconds of charging the attack rate bonus will become active at a 40% reduction in the base stat
  * Between 2.8 seconds and 7 seconds the bonus will ramp up to 100%, and will remained capped there. Any additional charge time will have no effect
  * After 40 seconds the effects of warcry will end immediately
  
### Battle Difficulty Bonuses

When playing on different difficulty settings for battles **enemy** units get the following additional chance to hit when attacking another unit

```
Easy:    -6
Normal:  +0
Hard:    +4
Extreme: +7
```

This means on higher difficulties enemy units will have an easier time hitting and dealing damage to enemies

### Experience Chevrons

Experience effects both the attack strength and the accuracy of the attacks. 

#### Chance to hit bonus

When a unit receives an attack, the change of the attack to hit and deal damage is calculated based on the difference in experience between the two units

The modifier is calculated by using the following formula and looking up the result in the table below

Formula: `9 + (attacker's experience - defender's experience)`

| -9 | -8 | -7 | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| -6 | -5 | -4 | -4 | -3 | -3 | -2 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

Having more experience will therefore not only increase the chance to hit of a unit, but also lessen the bonus that more experienced units get against that unit

Note that if the attack is made by a non-unit entity (i.e. a gatehouse pouring boiling oil or a tower shooting an arrow) the experience of the attacker is assumed to be 0

#### Missile Accuracy

 * When calculating the angle to fire at for ranged units, the game applies an offset of up to 0.45 to the desired angle
 * For every bar of experience, this offset is reduced by 0.05
 * This means that units with 9 chevrons of experience will be able to perfectly hit what they're aiming at
 * Note that the above chance to hit table still applies when a missile hits something (except in the case of seige engine projectiles i.e. onagers), so ranged units with more experience are not only more likely to hit what they're aiming at, but also more likely to actually deal damage to whatever they hit

### Eagle Units

 * Eagle units have a `+4` morale boost to the all friendly units within the area of influence.
 * Similar to monks the morale boost is only effective on other units not themselves.
 * You cannot stack multiple Eagle bonuses at once, only a single one will count for any specific unit. You can however have a unit gain a bonus from an Eagle and Chanting or Screeching at the same time.
 * The effect has a range of 75 using the internal engine distance this should be assumed to be similar to meters inside the game world.
 
### Fear Effects

When a unit has a modifier that means they are afraid of a certain type of unit this is calculated in the following manner.

 * The fear will impact the units morale value.
 * The modifier increases depending on the number of units nearby.
   * 1 unit:          -4 morale
   * 2 units:         -6 morale
   * 3 or more units: -8 morale
 * Multiple units of the same type can be stacked, you don't need to use separate types of unit to increase the bonus.
 * The effect has a range of 100 using the internal engine distance this should be assumed to be similar to meters inside the game world.

### Formation Bonuses

Some formations have some bonuses, these are:

Wedge: +10 Attack & -5 Defence
Testudo: -10 Attack & +5 Defence
Shield Wall: -10 Defence
Cantabrian Circle: +3 to missile attacks

Horde, Column, Square, Phalanx, Wall and Schiltrom have no Attack or Defence bonuses. 

## Campaign Calculations and Bonuses

### Campaign Difficulty bonuses

  * AI gets a bonus to income of 120%
  * AI values human regions 300% more
  * brigands can attack human settlements
  
NOTE: `human can get up to [X] turns of peace` means after the human has been at peace for [X] turns the AI will force someone to attack you. This will appear in the Campaign AI log file as `ltgd: invade '%s' set for forced attack on human`

### Religious Inheritance Logic

Bribing another factions character doesn't effect anything. The character's religion is simply whatever the one with the highest conversion in their traits. If a character has 0 conversion in any religion they're automatically given, in order of preference:
1) the faction leader's religion (not applicable to slaves)
2) the religion of the settlement they're in
3) the default religion of the faction
4) the first religion in the list

So what happens when a child is being born without any traits they'll then taking the religion of the faction leader using the logic above.

You can use the Inherit_chance trait attribute to make children inherit their parent's religions

## Siege Turn Calculations

Below is the calculation to work how how long a settlement can hold out. 

First, take the settlement type to get the minimum number of turns:

  * Village - 2 Turns
  * Town - 3 Turns
  * Large town - 4 Turns
  * Minor city - 4 Turns
  * Large city - 5 Turns
  * Huge city - 5 Turns

Now take the `wall_level` value then add `+1` then add the result to the value above. 

Finally add governor's management level divided by 3 (rounded down to nearest number)


**NOTE:**

  * If you have no wall the wall_level value is technically  `-1` so the calculation will be `-1 + 1 = 0` so you add nothing to the value.
  * Add -4 if the settlement has plague
  * Forts are hardcoded to have 3 turns when an army is in them
  * No matter the other modifers the settlement cannot go below the minimum number of turns based on it's settlement level.
